Fixes:
 - UNIT TESTING

New Features for Existing Functions:
 - Add an argument for TB - Nil for the TSPOT
   This is more difficult than it seems because of the borderlines.  Would
   have to create another version of the function without borderlines (which
   is basically what the non-NA criteria are, I think)

 - Add an argument to specify different criteria sets - North Am vs Global

 - Check that all test inputs are positive.

 - Add "test could not be interpreted" result to the functions.


New Functionality:
 - Given the numerous factors involved in interpreting TST results, is it 
   feasible to code a TST interpretation function?

 - Programmatic access to the BCG World Atlas?
