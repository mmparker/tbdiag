Description: This package contains two functions for the interpretation of interferon-gamma release assays (the Cellestis Quantiferon Gold In-Tube and the Oxford Immunotec TSPOT.TB).  Both of these functions currently use the North American criteria, but the addition of other criteria is planned.  Suggestions for other utilities are gratefully accepted.
